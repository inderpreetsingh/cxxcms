CXXCMS
-------
The C++ CMS Project, an application to run websites, etc. using C++. 
We have a lot of CMSes in Python/PHP, but not in C++. C++, is one of
the fastest languages and this application is for sites, which expect
a large number of hits. We all know that Facebook designed a PHP to C++
converter because PHP was very slow and lagging the site when the site 
started getting a large number of hits. This is an open source project, 
licensed under GNU GPL v3. The project mailing list is located at 
http://groups.google.com/group/cxxcms

Please note: This project has no relation with the C++ Web Development 
Framework as described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CppCMS and 
http://cppcms.sf.net. We are considering a rename on this and a decision 
will be taken soon.

The project's main repository is at https://bitbucket.org/nileshgr/cxxcms and
there is a git mirror at https://github.com/nileshgr/cxxcms
