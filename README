CXXCMS
-------
The C++ CMS Project, an application to run websites, etc. using C++. 
We have a lot of CMSes in Python/PHP, but not in C++. C++, is one of
the fastest languages and this application is for sites, which expect
a large number of hits. We all know that Facebook designed a PHP to C++
converter because PHP was very slow and lagging the site when the site 
started getting a large number of hits. This is an open source project, 
licensed under GNU GPL v3.
